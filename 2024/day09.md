## Description?
Container scanning tools, industry publications, and application security experts are constantly telling us about best practices for how to build our images and run our containers.
Often these non-functional requirements seem abstract and are not described well enough for those of us that donâ€™t have an appsec background to fully understand why they are important.

This session explores several of the most common secure container practices, shows examples of how workloads can be exploited if not followed and, most importantly,
how to easily find and fix issues when building containers BEFORE you ship them.
Additionally, we'll discuss tactics to minimize exploit exposure by hardening runtime container and Kubernetes configurations.
